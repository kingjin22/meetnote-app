# MEETNOTE-1 Discovery Report (2026-02-06)

## 0) Outcome
- Establish baseline understanding of current meetnote Flutter app structure/screens and set standard progress reporting.

## 1) E2E process (input → processing → output)
> Current app appears to be a multi-feature shell (meeting automation / n8n workflow / news crawler).
> TODO: Confirm intended end-to-end flow for meeting note generation (voice→STT→minutes) and where it will live.

## 2) UI/client work done
- Existing screens found:
  - Home screen
  - meeting_automation_screen
  - n8n_workflow_screen
  - news_crawler_screen
- Previously fixed: const-related compile errors in AppBar usage (per earlier logs).

## 3) Models/AI
- Not integrated yet in this repo.
- Target (planned): STT + LLM minutes (Korean fixed) — to be defined.

## 4) Data/state
- Current domain entities observed: feature entities for meeting_automation / n8n_workflow / news_crawler (see lib/features/*/domain).
- TODO: Define core entities (Recording, Transcript, Minutes) and processing states (queued/processing/succeeded/failed).

## 5) Current status (commands run + results)
- Repo: /Users/sungjinchoi/clawd/apps/meetnote/meetnote-app
- Git: 35dd772
- Flutter test:

- Key paths:
  - lib/main.dart
  - lib/app/router/app_router.dart
  - lib/app/theme/app_theme.dart
  - lib/features/*

## 6) Next actions (1–3) + DoD
1) Clarify product scope vs naming (meetnote vs memonote)
   - DoD: single agreed E2E flow documented (voice→STT→minutes) and feature flags for non-core screens.
2) Implement minimal voice→text pipeline stub (UI + status)
   - DoD: record/upload placeholder + processing state shown in UI (even if backend is mock).
3) Add CI to run flutter test
   - DoD: GitHub Actions (or equivalent) runs flutter test on push/PR.

## 7) Risks/decisions
- Risk: multiple experimental features may distract from core voice→minutes outcome; need prioritization.
- Decision needed: whether meetnote-app is the main client for the voice→minutes product, or a separate app.
